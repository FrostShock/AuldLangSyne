This is a fork of the project https://github.com/Road-block/AuldLangSyne
It simply disables the class colors for Friends List because it's bugged. Thanks to Disq @ Darrowsire for nuking the hook part.

\"Should auld acquaintance be forgot, you'll need something to remember them by.\"

## Description:
**AuldLangSyne** combines the functions of CT_PlayerNotes and FriendsFacts.

It will remember information about friends and display it in your friends list while they are offline.

It also allows you to write short notes about these friends.

Type /auld for a (very minimal) command listing or use the FuBar icon.

If you already use CT_PlayerNotes, load the game with both addons enabled, and type "/auld ctimport" to load its notes.  (Due to the way CT_PlayerNotes stores its data, you will have to do this once for each character whose friends you have made notes on.)

### FAQ:
Q: WTF is the name AuldLangSyne, d00d?  
A: Well, Timmy, Auld Lang Syne is the name of a song, mostly sung around New Years Eve, whose opening line goes "should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind."  (Literally, "auld lang syne' translates from Scots as "old long since", but may be better rendered as "times gone by".)  
In this, as in all things, Wikipedia shall be your guide: [Auld_Lang_Syne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auld_Lang_Syne)  
I didn't expect this to be so little known.  ;_;
